Description: Linux container runtime
 Docker complements LXC with a high-level API which operates at the process
 level. It runs unix processes with strong guarantees of isolation and
 repeatability across servers.
 Docker is a great building block for automating distributed systems:
 large-scale web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment systems,
 private PaaS, service-oriented architectures, etc.
