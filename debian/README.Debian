Docker on Debian
================

To enable docker memory limitation, the kernel needs to be loaded with
boot parameters: cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1. You can do so
by editing /etc/default/grub and extending GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX like:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1", then running
update-grub, and reboot.
